# Day 5: Windows Server 2022 Installation
## Steps
The objective of this section is to have a Windows Server with RDP exposed to the Internet. We'll follow the same process as before to create a server, except this time, we will not include this server within our VPC (virtual private cloud). When the computer is compromised, we want it to be isolated from our private network. 

I'm going to call it **windows2022**.
