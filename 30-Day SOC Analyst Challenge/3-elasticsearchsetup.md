# Day 3: Elasticsearch Setup
## Introduction
Today, I'll be setting up Elasticsearch using Vultr as my virtual machine/server provider. To start, let's set up our VPC 2.0 Network. To do this in Vultr, it's as easy as navigating to `Network` and selecting `VPC 2.0`.

Now, let's make a virtual machine for Elasticsearch.

After logging in with the password automatically generated by Vultr, it's time to install Elasticsearch. First, I ran `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y` (as per usual). After updating, we can download Elasticsearch using the command `wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.16.0-amd64.deb`. I retrieved the link from Elastic's download page which can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch). After installing the Debian package with `dpkg`, we get some important security information. We need to save this information somewhere as it contains our superuser password.

After, I navigated to `/etc/elasticsearch/` to find the `elasticsearch.yml` file. This contains all the important configurations. By default, Elasticsearch is only accessible on localhost. If we want our SOC analyst to be able to access our Elasticsearch instance, it will be via the public IP address of our machine. Importantly, previous to this, I created a firewall that only allows SSH connections from my IP address.

Once we have our `elasticsearch.yml` file configured, we can finally start the service

## Summary
Today I successfully created my server and installed Elasticsearch. On Day 4, we will be installing Kibana! ðŸš€
