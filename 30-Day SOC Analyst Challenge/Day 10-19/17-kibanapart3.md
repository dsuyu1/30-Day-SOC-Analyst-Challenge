# Day 17: Creating Alerts and Dashboards in Kibana
## Objective
This section aims to create a dashboard for the RDP activity generated by our vulnerable Ubuntu server.

## Steps
If you remember, last time, to create a dashboard, I went to Maps and made a new map to add to my dashboard. The process is simple, and I repeated the same thing here.

<p align="center"><i>Ref 1: Saving a map from the Maps tab.</i></p>
<br>

I used the query `agent.name: windows2022 and event.code: 4624 and (winlog.event_data.LogonType: 10 or winlog.event_data.LogonType: 7)` to filter for successful RDP connections, and `agent.name: windows2022 and event.code: 4625` to filter for unsuccessful RDP attempts. 

- Event ID [4625](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4625) represents an unsuccessful login.
- Event ID [4624](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4624) represents a successful login.

When it comes to event ID 4624, there are specific logon types we're looking for:

- Logon type 3 `Network`: Network connection.
- Logon type 7 `Unlock`: The workstation was unlocked.
- Logon type 10 `RemoteInteractive`: A user logged on to this computer remotely using Terminal Services or Remote Desktop.

Specifically for RDP, the logon type can be type 7 or type 10.

Now that our dashboard looks a little more robust, we can start making it look prettier. We can add a table that contains the usernames, countries, and IP addresses from where we're being attacked. We can achieve this by selecting "Create visualization." Here, we can make graphs and charts to visualize the data. By the way, this is thanks to Kibana Lens. To make a table:

- Make sure you're putting from the correct data view.
- Write the correct query for the fields you're looking for (event.code, user.name, etc.)
- Drag and drop the fields you want to have displayed in your visual.
- Save it!

I made tables for both SSH successes and failures and RDP successes and failures.

## Summary
In this section, I gained experience working with Kibana Lens and making tables to use within our dashboard. Our dashboard not only has nice colorful maps, but tables that give us a high-level view of the incoming attacks. I'm gaining experience with creating dashboards and creating alerts and rules.
