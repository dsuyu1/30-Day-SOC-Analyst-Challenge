# Day 11: Brute Force Attacks
## Introduction
The objective for today is to learn more about brute force attacks, common tools, and how to protect myself. 

### What is a brute force attack?
A brute force attack is an attack where an attacker uses every possible combination to try and gain unauthorized access. These attacks are done in an automated fashion.

### Dictionary Attacks
A dictionary attack is a type of brute force attack that uses a list of commonly used words, phrases, and/or passwords that are found in credential dumps.

### Credential stuffing 
Credential stuffing is when an attacker uses all the credentials in a credential dump in an attempt to gain unauthorized access. Credential stuffing takes advantage of people who reuse passwords by automating login attempts against systems using known emails and password pairs.  

### Protecting ourselves
We can protect ourselves from brute force attacks via:

- Long passwords/passphrases
- MFA (multi-factor authentication)
- Stay vigilant and be paranoid!

Check if you've been [pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) regularly!

### Common tools
Common brute force attack tools include:

- Hydra
- Hashcat
- John the Ripper

In this project, we're going to be observing brute force attacks in real time! See you there!
