# Day 22: Creating Alerts and Dashboards in Kibana
## Objective
In this section, I'll create an alert and dashboard based on the telemetry generated by Mythic.

## Steps
If you remember, last section, I performed a brute force attack and established a command and control session. To do this, I had to install and run a payload on the target Windows computer. This process creation can be viewed within our Elasticsearch logs, and that's what we'll be doing in this section.
