# Day 22: Creating Alerts and Dashboards in Kibana
## Objective
In this section, I'll create an alert and dashboard based on the telemetry generated by Mythic.

## Steps
If you remember, last section, I performed a brute force attack and established a command and control session. To do this, I had to install and run a payload on the target Windows computer. This process creation can be viewed within our Elasticsearch logs, and that's what we'll be doing in this section.

<p align="center"><i>Ref 1: Searching for the process creations of the payload that let us establish a C2 session.</i></p>
<br>

With the query `event.code: 1 and (winlog.event_data.Hashes: *FF65AE48B9572FE896BC6656FD0921E5E1A89C7D932446F02F0C62DA14D26343* or winlog.event_data.OriginalFileName: "Apollo.exe")`, I'm going to make a new rule.

This query: `event.code: 1 and event.provider: "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon"` finds event creations that Sysmon picked up on and sent over to us.
