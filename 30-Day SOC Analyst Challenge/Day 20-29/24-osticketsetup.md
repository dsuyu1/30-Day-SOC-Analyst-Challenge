We're going to deploy a brand new Windows machine. To get started, we're going to host this ticketing system on a web server. Therefore, we're going to use XAMPP from Apache.

Once installed, I'll navigate to the Properties file under the XAMPP directory. Here, we can right-click the `properties` file to edit the settings. For example, first, I'll change the Apache domain name from localhost (127.0.0.1) to our public IP address.

I'll also make edits to the `phpMyAdmin` configuration file.
